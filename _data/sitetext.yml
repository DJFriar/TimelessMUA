    body: "Christina Couch is a passionate, certified makeup artist with versatile experience. Fortunate enough to be part of the last Napoleon Perdis Makeup Academy alumni in Hollywood, she graduated June 2015 with a certificate in Fashion, Bridal, and Glamour makeup. She calls herself the timeless makeup artist due to her love for historical looks and her strive to specialize in historically accurate makeup. Her inspirations vary from film, music, drawings, and photography. Timeless faces that inspire Christina throughout history include pop culture figures from Marie Antoinette, to Gloria Swanson, to Patrick Nagel girls. She has a love for avant-garde as much as she does elegance and class. But most importantly Christina loves to leave her clients feeling beautiful inside and out- encouraging them to embrace who they are, what they like and what makes them feel good, even if it's not \"trending.\" That's truly timeless. You can find out more about Christina through her interview with Voyage magazine here: http://voyagela.com/interview/meet-pasadena-makeup-artist-christina-couch-2/"
